﻿# 📊 CreditPathAI

CreditPathAI is an **end-to-end AI-powered credit risk assessment system** that predicts loan default probability and provides **actionable recommendations** for lenders.  
The project covers the **complete machine learning lifecycle** — from data ingestion to model deployment and frontend dashboards.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Loan defaults cause significant financial losses for lending institutions.  
CreditPathAI helps mitigate this risk by:

- Predicting the probability of loan default using ML models
- Exposing predictions via a FastAPI backend
- Visualizing risk and recommendations through a React dashboard

This project is built as a **production-ready ML system**, not just a model.

---

## 🎯 Project KPIs

- AUC-ROC for loan default prediction
- Precision & Recall for high-risk borrowers
- Confusion Matrix and Threshold Analysis
- Model inference time via FastAPI
- Dashboard usability & recommendation clarity
